# Dockerfile for building a Go application and generating the corresponding
# application Dockerfile for it.  It expects the following build-args:
#   go_version - Go SDK version to be bundled in this image.
#   base_digest - distroless/base digest for use when generating application Dockerfile.
#   build_tag - Docker label added into generated application image to identify builder.
# When this builder image is executed, it expects the application source files
# to be mounted at the current work directory.
